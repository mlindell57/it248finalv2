                <h2>Security and Ethics in Information Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    Security and Ethics in IA is the most important because it not only protects your customers from bad actors,
                    but it protects your reputation as a business providing a service. An article from NSG states
                    “When customers interact with a business, they entrust their personal information, assets, and well-being.”
                    This highlights the importance of security to keep your customers coming back; if they feel like their security
                    is not at risk, they will be more likely to return to your website.

                <h2>Systems Design, Engineering, and Organization</h2>
                <p>
                    Systems Design is ranked second because the way a system is designed not only affects the user’s mood, but it is
                    also important that the design can be scalable as the size of your organization grows.

                <h2>User Experience and Visual Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Having an appealing design works hand-in-hand with good digital-environment design. It improves the experience for
                    users and entices them to utilize the environments that we are creating.

                <h2>Content and Information Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    Efficient Information Architecture allows information to flow smoothly through the entire environment.
                    If you have different ways to access environments, a solid Information Architecture will make transitions fluid.
                    A well-made IA will encourage users to discover products they might not have initially sought.
